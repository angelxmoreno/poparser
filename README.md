== PO Parser

This a PHP parser for Gettext PO files. It can extract the strings and translations from the file, and can provide statistic about the state of the translation - i.e. how many strings have been translated, how many are fuzzy, etc. It is useful to provide translations reports such as this one - http://app.etizer.org/translations

== Usage

See `example.php` for some examples.
