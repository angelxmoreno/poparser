==PO Parser

This a PHP parser for Gettext PO files. It can extract the strings and translations from the file. It can also provide statistics about the state of the translation - i.e. how many strings have been translated, how many are fuzzy, etc. It is useful to provide translation reports such as this one - http://app.etizer.org/translations
